# MetSizeR
Estimating Sample Sizes for Metabolomic Studies

MetSizeR is an R package for estimating sample sizes for metabolomic studies using the metsizer approach developed by G Nyamundanda and C Gormley from University College Dublin. This package builds on Nyamundandas gWidget interface in the [original MetSizeR package](https://github.com/cran/MetSizeR) by extracting the functionality within and exposing functions for simulating experimental pilot data and  estimating sample sizes required for full experiments. This package is designed to work hand in hand with the [MetabolAnalyze](https://github.com/cran/MetabolAnalyze) package for metabolomic practitioners.

The ultimate goals of this project are to provide a simple package for estimating sample sizes required for experiments and a Shiny application for ease of use for anyone, with or without knowledge of R.
